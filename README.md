This repository contains an implementation of a neural network in C++. The current version is a work in progress and still requires implementation of preprocessing functions.

### Implemented
- [X] Basic neural network architecture
- [X] Forward propagation
- [X] Backpropagation algorithm
- [X] Optimizers (SGD,ADAM)

### To Be Implemented
- [ ] Data preprocessing pipeline
- [ ] Feature normalization/scaling
- [ ] Data augmentation functions
